## Problem 1:
a.) Run SemiEmpiricalMassFormula1a.py by executing python SemiEmpiricalMassFormula1a.py  -  This will print out the answer for binding energy 

b.) Run SemiEmpiricalMassFormula1b.py by executing python SemiEmpiricalMassFormula1b.py  -  This will print out the answer for binding energy per nucleon

c.)Run SemiEmpiricalMassFormula1c.py by executing python SemiEmpiricalMassFormula1c.py  -  This will print out two statements, the answers to the question.

d.) Run SemiEmpiricalMassFormula1d.py by executing python SemiEmpiricalMassFormula1d.py  -  This will print out 100 lines of numbers, the value of Z and the supposed 'strongest' A for this Z value, I cannot seem to get this to work properly though. 

e.)Run SemiEmpiricalMassFormula1e.py by executing python SemiEmpiricalMassFormula1e.py  -  Be sure to have the nuclear_data.txt file in the local directory. When executing this file, it will create a file called aidansNuclearData.txt in the local directory. Then execute python plotNuclearData.py - This will display a plot of my calculated nuclear data to the data in the nuclear_data.txt file. Something is off here and my data is clearly wrong. I have been unable to diagnose this bug. 


## Problem 2:
a.) DO NOT RUN int_error.py - just view this file. I was unable to do this succesfully, but this file is my best attempt at it. 

b.) Run float_error.py by executing python float_error.py  -  This will print out two floats that cannot really be successfully subtracted or added together in python, along with a possible real world application

c.) Run float_compare.py by executing python float_compare.py - This will print the results of good and bad float comparing functions. The functions are checking if the two numbers (3^2 and 10.89) are equal to eachother.
